### Hi, I'm Francis! ðŸ‘‹

A front-end developer passionate about creating impactful, user-centered products that make a real difference. I find motivation in the opportunity to see real results from the work I undertake, knowing that I am contributing to something meaningful and valuable. Thriving in collaborative and forward-thinking environments, I bring a diverse background across industries including Airlines, Banks, Automotive, E-commerce, Marketplace, Arts and Museums, and the Crypto Space.

With over 5 years of experience, I specialize in utilizing technologies using Javascript, Typescript, Nuxt.js, Vue.js, React, CSS/SCSS/Sass/Less, Tailwind CSS, Git/Version control, Node.js, Firebase, Google APIs, and more for making awesome websites! My enthusiasm for learning drives me to stay updated on emerging technologies, design principles, and digital product development.

Beyond digital space, I am an avid mountaineer who finds joy in scaling peaks, discovering hidden waterfalls, and camping beneath the night sky.
