### Hi, I'm Francis! ðŸ‘‹

A solution-oriented front-end developer with experience building web applications in industries such as Airlines, Banks, Automotive, E-commerce, Marketplace, Arts and Museums, Events, and NFTs using cutting-edge modern frameworks and technologies.

I have 5 years+ of working experience using Javascript, Typescript, Nuxt.js, Vue.js, React, CSS/SCSS/Sass/Less, Tailwind CSS, Git/Version control, Node.js, Firebase, Google APIs, and others as my stack for making awesome websites! I'm passionate about learning new technologies, design, and digital products. 

Beyond digital space, I am a recreational mountaineer! I love climbing mountains, exploring waterfalls, and camping under the stars.
